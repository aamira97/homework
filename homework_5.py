"""
Problem 1

You have a list, you want to iterate over it and return the numbers that are divisible by 5.
If you iterate over a number larger than 500, stop the loop.
"""
ls = [5, 11, 30, 45, 175, 99, 106, 300, 490, 512, 890, 1000]


"""
Problem 2

Create a loop to print the reverse of a list. 
"""
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


"""
Problem 3

Write a function to get a number and return the factorial of the number. Use loops. 
ex. factorial of 5 is 1*2*3*4*5
You can't count factorial of negative numbers, and the factorial of 0 is 1. 
"""


"""
Problem 4

Write a code that would print list items that are at even positions. 
ex. in list = [10, 11, 12], 10 is at index 0, 11 - index 1 (odd), 12 - index 2 (even)
Use loops.
"""


"""
Problem 5

Write a function that gets a list of names and returns the ones that start with A.
Notice that some list items begin and end with spaces, or start with @. Get rid of space and @ before printing the name.
"""
names = [' Anna', "Lily", " Anahit ", "@Bob", "@Ani@", " Luiza@", "@@Armen"]

"""
Problem 6

Write a program that checks if a number is prime (պարզ) or not. Try not to google. :) 
"""


"""
Problem 7 (OPTIONAL)

Write a loop that will print this pattern.

Hint: print("\r") -> for printing on a new line, 
      print('*', end=' ') -> for printing on the same line
