Problem 3

Create a function that gets 3 numbers and returns the biggest of them.
Hint: You can use a function inside a function. 
"""


"""
Problem 4

Write a function that will return the volume (ծավալ) of a cylinder (գլան). 
You can pass the radius and the height to the function. 
Google how to calculate the volume of the cylinder.
You are going to need sqrt(square root, արմատ) and pi (I show those below)
"""
import math

print(math.sqrt(4))  # example of sqrt of 4 (4ի արմատ)
print(math.pi)


"""
Problem 5 (Calculator)

Write a function that accepts 3 variables -> number1, number2, operation.
operation can be +, -, *, /
The function should return the result of the operation with the two number.

Example: calculator(9, 3, '+') -> result is 12
In case of division, if the second number is 0, say that the operation cannot be completed.
"""


"""
Problem 6

Ask user to input something (text or number). Then check the type of the input 
and print a text "----'s type is ----".
In case of a float or int, cast the value as int and print it as well.

# Hints
# if int('10'):  --> this statement is True
# if type(8) == int:  --> this statement is True
