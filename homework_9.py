"""
Problem 1

Write a function that gets a set and an item. It returns the set without the item if it was present in the set.
"""

"""
Problem 2

Write a program that gets two sets. If they have the same items it deletes those items from both sets 
and prints them.
"""

"""
Problem 3

You have a list of tuples. Remove the tuples that have length 1.
"""

test_list = [(4, 5), (4, ), (8, 6, 7), (1, ), (3, 4, 6, 7)]

"""
Problem 4

You have two tuples.
Create tuples of all combinations of those tuple elements and store them in a list.
"""

tuple1 = (1, 5)
tuple2 = (7, 2)

"""
Problem 5

Convert a tuple to a float data type.
Example: (9, 56) - 9.56
"""


"""
Problem 6 

Write a program that will sort tuples by their maximum element.
"""

list1 = [(4, 5, 20, 7), (1, 3, 7, 4), (19, 4, 5, 3), (1, 2)]
