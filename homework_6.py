Problem 4

Create a list of names of all our group members.
Loop over the list and create files (filename = name).
Each file should contain the name of a person repeated as many times as the characters of the name.

for example: file -> Ani.txt
              text - > Ani
                       Ani
                       Ani
Ani is repeated 3 times as it has 3 characters.
